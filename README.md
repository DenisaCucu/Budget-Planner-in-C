# Budget Planner in C
 Project created for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. 


My project is a budget planner, in which a user can add, modify and delete a transaction, to see his financial summary of that day, his balance, and also deleting the account.

At the first run the user is prompted to enter his name and then to write his Savings Goals and his Monthly Income. By introducing his name in a file his name, the income and the expenses and also the balance are saved and when he re-enters the name his data will be loaded.
